# ACDC Student Portfolio - Om Prakash Sahu

I am a student following the ACDC MOOC. This repository documents my study notes and hands-on exercises in perception, mapping, fusion, planning and connected driving. Each module contains a notebook demo, code snippets and results for quick review.

## Quick links
- Module 01 - Sensor Data Processing I: Image segmentation, pointcloud segmentation, object detection
- Module 02 - Sensor Data Processing II: Occupancy mapping, camera BEV mapping, localization
- Module 03 - Object Fusion and Tracking: Prediction, association and fusion
- Module 04 - Vehicle Guidance: Navigation, guidance and stabilization
- Module 05 - Connected Driving: Collective cloud functions and V2I

## TL;DR highlights
- Image segmentation demo (IoU example) - module_01
- LiDAR occupancy grid mapping example - module_02
- Kalman filter fusion with RViz screenshots - module_03

See `SKILLS.md` for a compact skill-to-artifact mapping and `docs/module-index.md` for detailed module links.
