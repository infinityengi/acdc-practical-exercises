## 📚 Theoretical Background

### Semantic Segmentation
Assigns a class label to every pixel in an image. In autonomous driving:
- **Road**: Drivable surface
- **Vehicle**: Cars, trucks, buses
- **Person**: Pedestrians, cyclists
- **Infrastructure**: Traffic signs, poles, buildings

### Instance Segmentation
Distinguishes between different instances of the same class:
- Multiple vehicles as separate objects
- Individual pedestrians in a crowd
- Separate lanes on multi-lane roads

### Loss Functions
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Standard classification loss
- **Focal Loss**: Addresses class imbalance
- **Dice Loss**: Optimizes overlap directly
- **Combined Losses**: Weighted combinations for better performance

## 🔬 Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Lane Detection
Implement a semantic segmentation model to detect road lanes from dash cam footage.

**Objectives:**
- Preprocess road images (normalization, augmentation)
- Train a U-Net model for lane segmentation
- Evaluate model performance on test set
- Visualize predictions vs ground truth

### Exercise 2: Multi-Class Road Scene Parsing
Build a comprehensive road scene parser using DeepLab architecture.

**Classes to Segment:**
- Road surface
- Vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles)
- Pedestrians and cyclists
- Traffic signs and signals
- Sky and vegetation

### Exercise 3: Real-Time Vehicle Detection
Implement instance segmentation for precise vehicle detection and tracking preparation.

**Requirements:**
- Achieve >20 FPS inference speed
- Maintain high precision for safety-critical applications
- Handle various weather and lighting conditions

## 📈 Advanced Topics

### Data Augmentation Strategies
- **Geometric**: Rotation, scaling, cropping
- **Photometric**: Brightness, contrast, color jittering
- **Weather Simulation**: Rain, fog, snow effects
- **Domain Adaptation**: Synthetic to real data transfer

### Model Optimization
- **Quantization**: Reducing model precision for speed
- **Pruning**: Removing redundant network parameters
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Training smaller models from larger ones
- **Mobile Deployment**: Optimizing for embedded systems

### Evaluation Metrics
```python
# Example IoU calculation
def calculate_iou(pred_mask, true_mask):
    intersection = np.logical_and(pred_mask, true_mask)
    union = np.logical_or(pred_mask, true_mask)
    return np.sum(intersection) / np.sum(union)
```
